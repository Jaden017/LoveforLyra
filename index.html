  <div class="accordion-header">First date impression 😊</div>
  <div class="accordion-content">
    <p>Throwback to our first date. ദ്ദി(˵ •̀ ᴗ - ˵ ) ✧ You literally looked so good I was in disbelief I had an actual baddie with me. I did for some reason think you would be taller LOL. BUT... the green with the gray corset made me 🫦. I thought you were smart, obviously well educated, so pretty, had the cutest laugh, I would know I was so funny I always brought it out of you. And your eyes were so green, I never actually met someone in real life with green eyes so it honestly felt like I was with someone who doesn't exist in my world, truly a unicorn the way I feel like you are one of a kind.</p>

  <div class="accordion-header">First Kiss 🌸</div>
  <div class="accordion-content">
    <p>Wow that first kiss was MAGIC. It was a kiss that literally once our lips touched I stopped breathing for a second. Once we stopped I was like "lol why we stopping". That was the first kiss of many but that really told me everything I needed to know about our physical connection. From there on out we had it all baby, cuddles, holding hands, showers, and so on and so on(I'll keep it pg). But that was something I also never experienced before. I always thought  those "electic" kisses were just a over the top saying to make something more dramatic, but no it actually exist. I cannot wait to see you again and give you all the hugs and kisses I can. ( ˘ ³˘(◡‿◡˶)  </p>

  <div class="accordion-header">Memories We've Made 📸</div>
  <div class="accordion-content">
    <p>Literally don't get me stared 🫣.. Actually get me started because I love to talk about this. (∩˃ω˂∩). I am 25 years old at the time of making this website, I have travelled to many countries, many cities, and met many people, and theres noone who I experienced such simple but pure joy with other than you. Teaching you how to play chess, painting together, taking a bubble bath, these are just some of the memories we have together. So simple yet, I never felt so at peace doing anything else. I know you think I'm a bit crazy ꩜ ᯅ ꩜ ⁭and maybe I am, but I want to marry you. If I could spend my short life being able to come home to you, sing with you, clean, cook and just exist with you, then I must have truly been lucky in this life to get that privlege.</p>
